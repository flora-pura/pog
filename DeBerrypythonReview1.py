#Computational Thinking
#10th Grade
#Python Review Day 1


"""
Hey, 10th Graders! It's incredible to be back with you all
again, even if we have to be online.  I know we're going
to learn lots of cool things this year no matter how we
connect!

That said, here's what you're going to be reviewing today:

 -->   Syntax     <---
    a. Spelling
    b. Punctuation
    c. Spacing


Here's how you complete today's assignment:

1. Read the full instructions (this long comment in green!)

2. Debug the FOUR Python statements below

3. Don't forget to RUN the document in order to test your answers! If
your file runs without problems, you're all good to turn in!

This work should take you about 30 minutes.  Make sure to ask for help
and turn your work in as soon as you can!

#Syntax Debugging Section
#The following are four bits of code that contain errors
#Debug them until they return no errors when you RUN the file



#Problem 1:

print("Hello, world!")

print("The next problems draw a square")



#Problem 2

import turtle

window = turtle.screen()
      
cube = turtle.Turtle()


#Problem 3

for x in range( 0 , 4):
    cube.forwad(100)
    cube.Right (90)




#Problem 4

print ("if I debugged correctly I shouldn't get errors")
print("but if I don't then there will be a lot of errors")
